# Factory Pattern in Dart

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates the **Factory Design Pattern** in Dart. The `ShapeFactory` class provides a way to create instances of different `Shape` types (`Circle`, `Rectangle`, `Square`) based on a given input string.

## 📂 Project Structure
```sh
Task2/
│-- shape.dart
│-- shape_factory.dart
│-- main.dart
│-- README.md
```

### 🔹 `shape.dart`
Defines the `Shape` interface and its concrete implementations (`Circle`, `Rectangle`, `Square`).

### 🔹 `shape_factory.dart`
Implements the `ShapeFactory` class to generate `Shape` objects based on input.

### 🔹 `main.dart`
Contains the `main()` function that demonstrates how to use the `ShapeFactory` to create `Shape` objects dynamically.
